## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Overview

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Primary purpose** | Visualise employee survey data from a JSON file; provide a quick analytics dashboard that can be exported to DOCX. |
| **Business domain** | Human Resources / People Analytics. |
| **Target users** | HR analysts, managers, or any stakeholder who owns survey data and wants an instant, shareable snapshot. |
| **Use cases** | ‚Ä¢ Drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop a survey JSON<br>‚Ä¢ Inspect executive summary, key metrics, leadership performance, and qualitative insights<br>‚Ä¢ Export the rendered data to a Word document |
| **Core value proposition** | Zero‚Äësetup, instant analytics with a polished UI; eliminates the need to manually copy‚Äëpaste or build custom reports. |
| **Architecture pattern** | **Front‚Äëend‚Äëonly** SPA built with Next.js. All data is processed in the browser; no persistent backend or database. |

:::success
**Key Strength**: The application provides immediate value without requiring complex setup or backend infrastructure.
:::

### System Architecture

The application follows a client-side processing pattern:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor #1f2937
skinparam defaultTextColor #ffffff
skinparam componentBackgroundColor #374151
skinparam componentBorderColor #6b7280

actor "HR Analyst" as user
component "Next.js App" as app
component "File Upload" as upload
component "Data Validator" as validator
component "Dashboard" as dashboard
component "DOCX Exporter" as exporter
database "Browser Storage" as storage

user -> app : Upload JSON
app -> upload : Handle File
upload -> validator : Validate Data
validator -> storage : Store Validated Data
storage -> dashboard : Display Analytics
dashboard -> exporter : Generate Report
exporter -> user : Download DOCX
@enduml
```

> **Observation:** The "backend" is essentially the browser ‚Äì great for a self‚Äëcontained demo but limits persistence, security, and scalability.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Stack Analysis

| Layer | Stack | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer‚ÄëMotion, Lucide icons | Modern stack; strong type safety; Tailwind provides rapid styling. |
| **State mgmt** | Local `useState`, `useCallback`, context not used | Sufficient for current size; could grow to use a state library if needed. |
| **File handling** | Native `FileReader`, custom validation, `docx` & `file-saver` for export | All done on client; no server side. |
| **Testing** | **Missing** | No Jest / React Testing Library. |
| **Linting / Formatting** | ESLint (Next.js config), Tailwind CSS config, Prettier (via ESLint) | Good baseline. |
| **Build** | Turbopack (next dev / build) | Fast builds; upcoming Next.js default. |
| **Deployment** | Not specified (likely Vercel / Netlify) | Static export is trivial. |
| **Third‚Äëparty services** | `docx` (doc generation), `file-saver` (file download) | All local; no external APIs. |

:::warning
**Missing Dependencies**: The project lacks testing frameworks and security libraries for HTML sanitization.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Implementation Flow

The application follows this data processing workflow:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor #1f2937
skinparam defaultTextColor #ffffff
skinparam activityBackgroundColor #374151
skinparam activityBorderColor #6b7280

start
:User uploads JSON file;
:Validate file format;
if (Valid JSON?) then (yes)
  :Parse survey data;
  :Validate data structure;
  if (Valid structure?) then (yes)
    :Store in component state;
    :Render dashboard tabs;
    :Display analytics;
    if (Export requested?) then (yes)
      :Generate DOCX;
      :Download file;
    endif
  else (no)
    :Show validation error;
  endif
else (no)
  :Show file format error;
endif
stop
@enduml
```

### Error Handling
* **Client‚Äëside**: Uses local `error` state in `Home` page.  
* **Validation**: Basic guard for file type & required fields.  
* **Export**: `try/catch` around doc generation with user‚Äëvisible error message.

:::info
**Error Handling Strategy**: The application uses a centralized error state management approach with user-friendly error messages.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Security Analysis

:::error
**Critical Security Issue**: XSS vulnerability in InsightsTab component requires immediate attention.
:::

* **XSS Risk**: `InsightsTab` renders raw HTML via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitisation ‚Üí potential XSS if JSON contains malicious markup.  
* **No authentication** ‚Äì Expected for a demo, but if deployed publicly, could expose raw JSON files.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Component Architecture

The application uses a well-structured component hierarchy:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor #1f2937
skinparam defaultTextColor #ffffff
skinparam componentBackgroundColor #374151
skinparam componentBorderColor #6b7280

package "App Layer" {
  [Home Page] as home
  [Layout] as layout
}

package "Feature Components" {
  [FileUpload] as upload
  [SurveyDashboard] as dashboard
  [ExportButton] as export
}

package "Dashboard Tabs" {
  [OverviewTab] as overview
  [StatisticsTab] as stats
  [LeadershipTab] as leadership
  [InsightsTab] as insights
}

package "UI Components" {
  [DashboardHeader] as header
  [InsightModal] as modal
  [LeadershipTable] as table
}

package "Utilities" {
  [docxExporter] as docx
  [validateSurveyData] as validator
}

home --> upload
home --> dashboard
home --> export
dashboard --> overview
dashboard --> stats
dashboard --> leadership
dashboard --> insights
overview --> header
insights --> modal
leadership --> table
export --> docx
upload --> validator
@enduml
```

### Code Quality Metrics

```typescript
// Example of well-structured TypeScript interface
interface SurveyData {
  metadata: {
    title: string;
    date: string;
    participants: number;
  };
  responses: SurveyResponse[];
  analytics: {
    satisfaction: number;
    engagement: number;
    retention: number;
  };
}

// Clean component structure with proper typing
const SurveyDashboard: React.FC<SurveyDashboardProps> = ({ 
  data, 
  onExport 
}) => {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<TabType>('overview');
  
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-container">
      {/* Component implementation */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
