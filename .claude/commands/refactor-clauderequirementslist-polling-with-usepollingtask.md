# refactor-clauderequirementslist-polling-with-usepollingtask

## Description

Replace ClaudeRequirementsList's manual setInterval polling with the new `usePollingTask` hook to eliminate race conditions and manual cleanup logic. This refactoring will remove the isExecutingRef flag pattern and ensure proper AbortController cleanup on component unmount or requirement changes, fixing issues #18 and #20.

## Implementation Steps

1. Locate the polling logic in ClaudeRequirementsList component (likely in useEffect with setInterval) and identify the polling function, interval duration, and current cleanup mechanism
2. Replace setInterval pattern with `usePollingTask` hook call, passing the polling function and interval as options, capturing the returned loading/error states
3. Remove manual cleanup code (clearInterval calls) and isExecutingRef flag usage, relying instead on the hook's built-in AbortController cleanup
4. Update component state management to use the hook's returned states (isLoading, error) instead of manual state updates from the polling function
5. Add error boundary or toast notification for polling failures using the hook's error state, improving user visibility of polling issues
6. Test the refactored component with rapid requirement changes, unmounting, and network failures to verify race conditions are eliminated

## Files to Modify

- app/features/requirements/components/ClaudeRequirementsList.tsx
- app/features/requirements/components/__tests__/ClaudeRequirementsList.test.tsx

## UI/UX Innovation Experiment

Add a shimmer skeleton loader that appears during polling intervals, with animated waves that sync with the polling frequency, creating a cohesive visual rhythm that communicates the polling state to users

## Recommended Next Goal

Create a polling configuration service to centralize polling intervals and retry strategies across the application, allowing feature flags for different polling behaviors
