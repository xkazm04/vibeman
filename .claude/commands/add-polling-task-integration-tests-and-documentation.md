# add-polling-task-integration-tests-and-documentation

## Description

Create comprehensive tests and documentation for the `usePollingTask` hook to ensure reliability and guide developers on proper usage. Tests should verify cleanup guarantees, AbortSignal propagation, error handling, and stale closure prevention. Documentation should include API reference, usage examples, and migration guide from manual setInterval patterns.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create test file `app/lib/hooks/__tests__/usePollingTask.test.ts` with vitest/jest tests covering: (1) successful polling execution at correct intervals, (2) cleanup on unmount via AbortSignal, (3) cleanup on explicit cancel() call, (4) error handling with onError callback, (5) stale closure prevention with changing dependencies, (6) immediate execution when option is true
2. Add test case for AbortError being silently ignored vs other errors being passed to onError callback
3. Create integration test in `app/features/claude-requirements/__tests__/ClaudeRequirementsList.integration.test.tsx` verifying the refactored component properly uses usePollingTask and cleans up on unmount
4. Write JSDoc documentation in usePollingTask.ts with @param, @returns, @throws, and @example sections showing real-world usage
5. Create `app/lib/hooks/POLLING_PATTERNS.md` documenting the migration path from manual setInterval to usePollingTask, including before/after code examples
6. Add performance notes in documentation about AbortSignal overhead being negligible vs race condition fixes gained

## Files to Modify

- app/lib/hooks/__tests__/usePollingTask.test.ts
- app/features/claude-requirements/__tests__/ClaudeRequirementsList.integration.test.tsx
- app/lib/hooks/usePollingTask.ts
- app/lib/hooks/POLLING_PATTERNS.md

## UI/UX Innovation Experiment

Create an interactive documentation component that demonstrates polling states (active, error, cancelled) with live animations - developers can toggle between states to see how the UI responds, making the hook's behavior immediately understandable.

## Recommended Next Goal

Monitor production usage of usePollingTask to identify any edge cases, then create a polling configuration registry for managing multiple concurrent polling tasks and their intervals globally
