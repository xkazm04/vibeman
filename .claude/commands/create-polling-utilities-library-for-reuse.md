# create-polling-utilities-library-for-reuse

## Description

Export the polling abstraction as a reusable utilities library with additional helpers for common polling scenarios (log refresh, status checks, health monitoring). Create a `usePollingTask` wrapper library in `app/lib/polling/` that includes preset configurations and factory functions for common use cases, making it easy for other features to adopt the polling pattern.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `app/lib/polling/index.ts` that exports the core `usePollingTask` hook and factory functions for common scenarios
2. Implement factory functions in `app/lib/polling/factories.ts`: `createLogRefreshPoller()`, `createStatusCheckPoller()`, `createHealthMonitorPoller()` with preset intervals, retry strategies, and error handling
3. Create `app/lib/polling/types.ts` with reusable TypeScript interfaces for PollingConfig, PollingResult, and PollerFactory patterns
4. Add configuration presets in `app/lib/polling/presets.ts` for different polling strategies (aggressive, conservative, adaptive) with documented use cases
5. Document the polling library in `app/lib/polling/README.md` with examples for log refresh, status checks, and custom use cases
6. Create integration tests in `app/lib/polling/__tests__/integration.test.ts` demonstrating multiple concurrent pollers and cleanup scenarios

## Files to Modify

- app/lib/polling/index.ts
- app/lib/polling/factories.ts
- app/lib/polling/types.ts
- app/lib/polling/presets.ts
- app/lib/polling/README.md
- app/lib/polling/__tests__/integration.test.ts

## UI/UX Innovation Experiment

Create a polling dashboard component that visualizes all active pollers in development mode, showing poll frequency, success/failure rates, and latency metrics with real-time sparkline charts

## Update FILE_STRUCTURE.MD

IMPORTANT: After implementing the changes, update the FILE_STRUCTURE.MD file in the context directory to reflect the latest changes.

Include:
1. New files created or modified
2. Updated component relationships
3. New patterns or architectural decisions

At the end of FILE_STRUCTURE.MD, add a "## Next Steps" section with your recommendation for the next goal or feature to implement based on the current progress.

## Recommended Next Goal

Implement adaptive polling that adjusts intervals based on success rates and user activity, reducing server load during low-activity periods while maintaining responsiveness
