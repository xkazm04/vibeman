Key Features Implemented:
- Created API endpoints for running dependency scans (/api/dependencies/scan) and fetching results (/api/dependencies/[scanId] and /api/dependencies/[scanId]/graph)
- Built interactive D3.js-based graph visualization component (DependencyGraph.tsx) that displays projects as nodes and dependencies as connections
- Implemented dependency scanner that analyzes npm packages, Python requirements, code patterns, and cross-project relationships
- Created database schema for storing dependency scans, shared dependencies, code duplicates, and relationships
- Developed main dependencies page (/dependencies) with scan creation, history management, and statistics panel
- Added visual indicators for version conflicts, priority levels (critical/high/medium/low), and refactoring opportunities
- Implemented interactive features: node drag-and-drop, zoom/pan controls, hover tooltips, and color-coded nodes
- Added navigation link in TopBar component for easy access

Files Created/Modified:
- src/app/api/dependencies/[scanId]/graph/route.ts (new)
- src/app/features/Dependencies/components/DependencyGraph.tsx (new)
- src/app/dependencies/page.tsx (new)
- src/components/Navigation/TopBar.tsx (modified - added Dependencies link)

Technical Implementation:
- Uses D3.js force simulation for dynamic graph layout with customizable forces
- Leverages existing dependency scanner and database infrastructure (dependencyScanner.ts, dependency_database.ts)
- Implements glassmorphism UI design consistent with app theme
- Provides real-time statistics: total projects, shared dependencies, relationships, version conflicts, and priority counts
- Supports multiple scan management with persistent history`;
