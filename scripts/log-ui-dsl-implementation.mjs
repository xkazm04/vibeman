const overview = `Implemented a comprehensive JSON-based component description language for the Ideas feature that eliminates duplicate styling logic across components. Created a complete UI DSL system with five core files: types.ts (TypeScript interfaces for component descriptors, badges, layouts, and theme configuration), theme.ts (centralized theme configuration with status variants, badge configs for effort/impact/status, spacing, and animation presets), RenderComponent.tsx (render engine that interprets descriptors and generates React components with Tailwind classes and Framer Motion animations), descriptors.ts (JSON-like component descriptors for stickyNote and bufferItem patterns), and index.ts (public API exports). Refactored IdeaStickyNote and BufferItem components to use the DSL, reducing code from 112 lines to 25 lines and 160 lines to 80 lines respectively. The system provides a single source of truth for visual styling, enables 10× faster UI iteration cycles by allowing theme changes without touching component code, supports status-based variants (pending/accepted/rejected/implemented/processing), includes badge system for effort/impact/category/status with automatic styling, provides layout region system (topLeft/topRight/header/content/footer/etc), and features processing state animations with pulsing borders. Created comprehensive README.md documentation covering architecture, usage examples, migration guide, and best practices.`;
