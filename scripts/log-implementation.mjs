const overview = `Implemented comprehensive interactive filter and control system for the Total view dashboard in the Reflector feature. Created TotalViewFilters.tsx as the main filter panel with sliding glassmorphism animation from the side. Built reusable filter components including ProjectFilter.tsx, ContextFilter.tsx, StatusFilter.tsx, DateRangeFilter.tsx, and SearchInput.tsx with consistent styling matching the app's yellow/amber color scheme. Implemented filterIdeas.ts with multi-filter logic supporting simultaneous filtering by project, context, status, date range, and text search. Updated TotalViewDashboard.tsx to accept filtered data as props and render with smooth Framer Motion transitions. Created ActiveFiltersDisplay.tsx component with clickable tag-based filter chips that users can remove individually. Integrated URL query parameter synchronization in page.tsx for filter state persistence across page reloads using Next.js useSearchParams and useRouter hooks. Added smart suggestions feature that recommends filters based on dashboard content (e.g., Last 30 Days, Current Quarter) with automatic detection of idea patterns. Included filter presets and quick-access date range buttons (7/30/90 days). All components follow React hooks patterns with useState for local state management and maintain visual consistency with the existing dark theme featuring glassmorphism effects, yellow/amber accents, and smooth animations.`;
