const overview = `Implemented a comprehensive Technical Debt Radar system with continuous monitoring, risk scoring, and automated remediation planning. Created complete database schema with tech_debt table supporting multiple categories (code_quality, security, performance, testing, documentation, dependencies, architecture, maintainability, accessibility). Built risk scoring algorithm that calculates 0-100 scores based on severity, age, file count, and business/technical impact. Developed intelligent remediation planner that generates step-by-step action plans customized per debt category. Created REST API endpoints for CRUD operations, statistics, scanning, and backlog integration. Built modern React UI with TechDebtRadar main component, TechDebtCard for item display, TechDebtStatsPanel for metrics visualization, and TechDebtDetailModal for comprehensive item management. Integrated seamlessly with existing backlog/proposal workflow allowing one-click conversion of tech debt to actionable backlog items. Implemented continuous monitoring scheduler with configurable intervals (daily/weekly/monthly) and automatic critical issue notifications. The system quantifies technical debt, prioritizes by risk, predicts future impact, and tracks remediation progress across all projects.`;
