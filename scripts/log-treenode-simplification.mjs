const overview = 'Unified the TreeNode interface by making the path property required (non-optional) and replaced all path-based selection helpers with a single selectPaths API in the store. This removes the need for multiple selection functions (selectFilesByPaths has been removed), reduces prop churn by eliminating fallback logic (node.path || node.id), and makes file-structure handling self-documenting. Key changes: (1) Updated TreeNode interface in src/types/index.ts to always include path property, (2) Added normalizePath helper and selectPaths method to src/stores/nodeStore.ts, (3) Updated getAllChildFiles to use node.path instead of node.id, (4) Replaced selectFilesByPaths with unified selectPaths API, (5) Updated TreeNode component and FileTreeSelector to use path directly without fallbacks, (6) Fixed src/app/api/project/structure/route.ts to include path in TreeNode return objects.';
