You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown headers, no code blocks, no tables, no explanations. Just pure JSON matching the exact format specified in your system prompt.

DO NOT use markdown formatting like ## headers or | tables |.
DO NOT wrap your response in code blocks like \`\`\`json.
ONLY output the raw JSON object starting with { and ending with }.

## Your Task

Based on the context description, file contents, and documentation above, provide your expert analysis and recommendations.
