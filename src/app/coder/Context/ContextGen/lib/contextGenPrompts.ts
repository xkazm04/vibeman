File Contents:
${fileContents.map((f) => `\n=== ${f.path} ===\n${f.content}`).join('\n')}

Generate a well-structured Markdown document with the following sections:

## Overview
Write a comprehensive overview (NO CHARACTER LIMIT - be thorough):
- What is the primary purpose/responsibility of these files?
- What problem do they solve or what feature do they implement?
- What are the main capabilities and features provided?

## Architecture
- What are the key architectural patterns or approaches used?
- How do the components interact with each other?
- What design decisions are evident in the code?

## File Structure
For EACH file, provide:
- **\`path/to/file.ts\`** - One-sentence description of its specific use case and responsibility

Format your response as JSON with a single "description" field containing the complete markdown:
{
  "description": "# Context Overview\\n\\n## Overview\\n...\\n\\n## Architecture\\n...\\n\\n## File Structure\\n...",
  "fileStructure": ""
}

IMPORTANT: 
- Return ONLY valid JSON with the description as a single string containing markdown
- Use \\n for line breaks within the JSON string
- Do NOT truncate the description
- Do NOT include the File Structure section in a separate field - it should be part of the markdown description
- Use proper markdown formatting (headings, bold, lists, etc.)`;
