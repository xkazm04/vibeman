Setup Instructions:

Update your config with actual GitHub repository URLs:

typescriptgit: {
  repository: 'https://github.com/yourusername/vibeman.git',
  branch: 'main',
  autoSync: true
}

Ensure Git is installed on your system and accessible from command line
Initialize Git in your project directories if not already done:

bashcd C:\Users\kazda\mk\vibeman
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/vibeman.git
Usage:

Check Status: Click the Git branch icon to see repository status
Pull Updates: Click "Pull" button when updates are available
Safety: The system prevents pulling when:

Server is running (stop it first)
You have uncommitted changes
There are merge conflicts



Advanced Features You Could Add:

Auto-sync on start:

typescript// In handleStart function
if (project.git?.autoSync) {
  await pullLatestChanges();
}

Commit & Push UI: Add buttons to commit and push changes
Branch Management: UI to create/switch branches
Diff Viewer: Show what files changed in the pull
Webhooks: Listen for GitHub webhooks to detect pushes instantly

The system is now fully integrated and ready to use! Just update the repository URLs in your config and you'll be able to pull updates directly from the app manager UI.
