# Reflector Total View - Filter System

## Overview

The Reflector Total View now includes a comprehensive filter system that allows users to filter implemented ideas by multiple criteria including project, context, status, date range, and text search.

## Features

### 1. Filter Panel (Glassmorphism Design)
- **Location**: Slides in from the right side of the screen
- **Toggle**: Click the "Filters" button in the dashboard
- **Design**: Features a glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur for a modern UI

### 2. Filter Types

#### Project Filter
- Filter ideas by one or more projects
- Select/deselect individual projects
- "Select All" / "Clear All" quick actions

#### Context Filter
- Filter by specific contexts within selected projects
- Automatically loads contexts for selected projects
- Includes "No Context" option for ideas without a context
- Grouped display matching the original context organization

#### Status Filter
- Filter by idea status:
  - Pending (blue)
  - Accepted (green)
  - Implemented (yellow)
  - Rejected (red)

#### Date Range Filter
- Custom date range selection with start and end dates
- Quick range buttons:
  - Last 7 Days
  - Last 30 Days
  - Last 90 Days

#### Text Search

### 3. Active Filters Display

### 4. Smart Suggestions
- AI-powered filter suggestions based on your data
- Automatically suggests:
  - "Last 30 Days" if you have recent ideas
  - Current quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) if applicable
- Click any suggestion to instantly apply that filter

### 5. URL Query Parameter Sync
- All filter states are synced to URL parameters
- Filters persist across page reloads
- Shareable URLs with pre-applied filters

Example URL with filters:
```
/reflector?projects=proj-1,proj-2&statuses=implemented&startDate=2024-01-01&search=authentication
```

### 6. Total View Dashboard
- Displays filtered ideas grouped by implementation date
- Shows statistics:
  - Total ideas count
  - Date range coverage
  - Top category
- Animated transitions when filters change
- Empty state messaging when no results match

## Usage

### Accessing Filters

1. Navigate to `/reflector`
2. Switch to "Reflection" tab (Total view)
3. Click the "Filters" button in the top-left area
4. The filter panel will slide in from the right

### Applying Filters

1. Select your desired filters in the panel
2. Filters are applied immediately as you select them
3. See real-time updates in the dashboard
4. Active filters appear as tags above the dashboard

### Removing Filters

**Individual filters:**
- Click the "X" on any filter tag

**All filters:**
- Click "Clear All" button next to the Filters toggle
- Or click "Clear All Filters" at the bottom of the filter panel

### Using Smart Suggestions

1. Click "Smart Suggestions" button
2. Review suggested filter presets
3. Click any suggestion to apply it instantly

## Filter State Management

Filters are managed through React state and synced with URL parameters:

```typescript
interface IdeaFilterState {
  projectIds: string[];
  contextIds: string[];
  statuses: string[];
  dateRange: {
    start: Date | null;
    end: Date | null;
  };
  searchQuery: string;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Filters are applied using optimized memoization (`React.useMemo`)
- Context data is loaded only when needed (when projects are selected)
- URL updates use `router.push()` with `scroll: false` for smooth UX
- Animations use Framer Motion with `AnimatePresence` for performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the filter system:

1. **Saved Filter Presets**: Allow users to save and name filter combinations
2. **Export Functionality**: Export filtered results to CSV, PDF, or JSON
3. **Advanced Search**: Support regex patterns or field-specific search
4. **Filter Presets**: "My Weekly Review", "High Priority Items", etc.
5. **Bulk Actions**: Perform actions on filtered results
6. **Filter Analytics**: Track which filters are most commonly used

## UI/UX Innovations

### Glassmorphism Panel
- Backdrop blur effect for modern aesthetics
- Semi-transparent background
- Smooth slide-in animation from the right

### Color-Coded Tags
- Each filter type has a unique color for quick identification
- Consistent color scheme across the application

### Smart Context Loading
- Contexts only load when projects are selected
- Reduces unnecessary API calls
- Shows loading states during fetch

### Responsive Design
- Filter panel adapts to screen size
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions
- Scrollable content areas for long lists

## Technical Notes

- Built with Next.js 15 App Router
- Uses React 19 with hooks for state management
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
