Based on the repository analysis above, generate exactly 3 high-level strategic directions that would transform this application into a high-quality, market-competitive product. Focus on user-centric value creation and market differentiation rather than just technical improvements.

**CRITICAL: Avoid duplicating any existing goals that have already been generated for this project.**

## Context Understanding Requirements:

Before generating goals, analyze the application's:
- **Core user workflow**: What is the primary user journey and where are the friction points?
- **Business model**: How does this application create and capture value?
- **Competitive landscape**: What similar solutions exist and how can this differentiate?
- **User segments**: Who are the primary and secondary user groups?
- **Technical constraints**: What are the current platform limitations and opportunities?

Return the directions in strict JSON format following this schema:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "string (2-5 words)",
    "description": [
      "Strategic initiative or capability to develop",
      "Key implementation milestone",
      "Additional strategic steps as needed"
    ],
    "type": "Business|Technical",
    "reason": "string (1-2 sentences explaining the market opportunity or competitive advantage)"
  }
]
```

## Selection Criteria (in priority order):

### 1. User Value Creation
- **Solve real user pain points**: Address frustrations, inefficiencies, or unmet needs
- **Reduce friction**: Eliminate steps, simplify workflows, automate repetitive tasks
- **Enable new capabilities**: Unlock possibilities users couldn't achieve before
- **Improve core workflows**: Enhance the primary user journey and key use cases

### 2. Market Differentiation
- **Unique value proposition**: Features competitors don't offer or do poorly
- **Network effects**: Capabilities that become more valuable with more users
- **Platform advantages**: Leverage existing strengths to create competitive moats
- **Modern expectations**: Meet or exceed current industry standards

### 3. Business Impact
- **Revenue potential**: Direct monetization opportunities or conversion drivers
- **User acquisition**: Features that attract new user segments or use cases
- **Retention drivers**: Capabilities that increase stickiness and reduce churn
- **Scalability enablers**: Infrastructure that supports growth without proportional costs

### 4. Implementation Feasibility
- **Achievable scope**: Realistic for 3-6 month development cycles
- **Resource alignment**: Matches available technical capabilities and team skills
- **Risk management**: Balanced approach between innovation and execution risk
- **Measurable outcomes**: Clear success metrics and validation approaches

## Quality Guidelines:

**Focus on outcomes, not features**: Describe the user benefit and business impact, not just the technical implementation

**Be specific about value**: Quantify improvements where possible (e.g., "reduce setup time by 80%", "enable 10x faster deployment")

**Consider the user journey**: How does this direction improve the end-to-end experience?

**Think ecosystem**: How does this create platform value and enable future innovations?

**Market timing**: Align with current trends and emerging user behaviors

## Strategic Direction Examples (for inspiration only - DO NOT copy):

**Good Example - User-Centric**:
```json
{
  "title": "Intelligent Automation Hub",
  "description": [
    "Build AI-powered workflow automation that learns from user patterns",
    "Create visual workflow builder with pre-built templates for common tasks",
    "Implement smart suggestions based on user behavior and industry best practices"
  ],
  "type": "Business",
  "reason": "Reduces manual work by 70% and creates sticky platform value that competitors can't easily replicate."
}
```

**Poor Example - Feature-Focused**:
```json
{
  "title": "Add More Buttons",
  "description": [
    "Add export button to dashboard",
    "Create new settings page",
    "Implement dark mode toggle"
  ],
  "type": "Technical",
  "reason": "Users requested these features in feedback."
}
```

## Final Instructions:

Ensure the JSON is valid and parseable. Mark as "Business" if primarily about user experience, market positioning, or revenue. Mark as "Technical" if about platform capabilities, performance, or infrastructure that enables business goals.

Generate strategic initiatives that create genuine user value and competitive advantage, not just feature additions. Each goal should be transformative enough to significantly impact user adoption, retention, or revenue potential.
