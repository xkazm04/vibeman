## Analysis Guidelines

### Goal-Related Queries
Look for these patterns that indicate the get_project_goals tool should be used:
- Questions about goals, objectives, targets, milestones
- Counting queries: "how many goals", "number of objectives"
- Status queries: "completed goals", "progress on objectives"
- Planning questions: "what is this project about", "project roadmap"
- Achievement tracking: "what have we accomplished"

### Keywords to Watch For
- **Goal keywords**: goal, objective, target, milestone, achievement, roadmap, plan
- **Count keywords**: how many, count, number of, total, amount
- **Status keywords**: completed, done, finished, in progress, pending, open
- **Overview keywords**: about, summary, overview, purpose, aims

### Decision Logic
1. **Direct goal questions** → Always use get_project_goals
2. **Project overview questions** → Use get_project_goals to understand project scope
3. **Planning/roadmap questions** → Use get_project_goals for strategic context
4. **General project questions** → Consider if goals would provide helpful context

## User Query Analysis
User message: "{{USER_MESSAGE}}"
Project ID: {{PROJECT_ID}}

## Your Task
Analyze the user's message and determine:
1. What is the user really asking for?
2. Which tools would provide the most helpful information?
3. What parameters should be used for each tool?
4. How will the tool results help answer the user's question?

## Response Format
Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:

\`\`\`json
{
  "needsTools": boolean,
  "toolsToUse": [
    {
      "name": "tool_name",
      "parameters": { "projectId": "project_id_here" }
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Clear explanation of why these tools were selected and how they help answer the user's question",
  "userIntent": "Brief summary of what the user is trying to accomplish"
}
\`\`\`

Be thoughtful in your analysis - the goal is to provide the most helpful response possible.`;
