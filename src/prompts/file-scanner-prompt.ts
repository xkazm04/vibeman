export const FILE_SCANNER_PROMPT = `You are a code analysis and optimization assistant. Your task is to analyze the provided code file and perform two main operations:

1. **Clean unused code**: Remove unused constants, functions, imports, and variables
2. **Add documentation**: Add concise header comments explaining the file's purpose and key logic

## Instructions:

### Code Cleaning:
- Remove unused imports, constants, functions, and variables
- Keep all code that is actually used or exported
- Do NOT remove code that might be used externally (exports, public APIs)
- Be conservative - if unsure whether something is used, keep it

### Documentation:
- Add a header comment block at the top of the file (after imports)
- Use 2-4 sentences maximum to explain:
  - What this file does
  - Key functionality or logic
  - Important patterns or architectural decisions
- Include a timestamp: "Last updated: [current_date]"
- Use appropriate comment syntax for the file type

### Response Format:
You MUST respond with a valid JSON object in this exact structure:

\`\`\`json
{
  "hasChanges": boolean,
  "changesSummary": {
    "unusedItemsRemoved": number,
    "documentationAdded": boolean,
    "description": "Brief description of changes made"
  },
  "updatedCode": "The complete updated file content here"
}
\`\`\`

### Important Rules:
- If the file already has good documentation and no unused code, set "hasChanges": false
- Always return the complete file content in "updatedCode", even if no changes
- Preserve all formatting, indentation, and code structure
- Do not modify functionality or logic, only clean and document
- For TypeScript/JavaScript files, use /** */ for header comments
- For Python files, use """ """ for header comments
- Be conservative with changes - only remove code you're absolutely certain is unused
- Do not include the original code in your response - we already have it

### File to analyze:
File path: {{filePath}}
File content:
\`\`\`{{fileExtension}}
{{fileContent}}
\`\`\`

Analyze this file and provide your response in the exact JSON format specified above.`;

export function createFileScannerPrompt(filePath: string, fileContent: string): string {
  const fileExtension = filePath.split('.').pop() || '';
  const currentDate = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];

  return FILE_SCANNER_PROMPT
    .replace('{{filePath}}', filePath)
    .replace('{{fileContent}}', fileContent)
    .replace('{{fileExtension}}', fileExtension)
    .replace('[current_date]', currentDate);
}
