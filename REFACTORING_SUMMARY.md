# TaskRunner Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Types Library
- **New file**: `src/app/features/TaskRunner/lib/types.ts`
- Moved interfaces from main page to centralized location:
  - `ProjectRequirement` interface
  - `TaskRunnerState` interface  
  - `TaskRunnerActions` interface

### 2. Refactored TaskRunnerHeader Component
- **Updated**: `src/app/features/TaskRunner/TaskRunnerHeader.tsx`
- **Moved from main page**:
  - `handleBatchRun()` function
  - `executeNextRequirement()` function with useCallback optimization
  - Auto-process queue useEffect logic
  - Error handling state management
- **New features added**:
  - Error display UI with dismiss functionality
  - Auto-delete requirements after successful completion
  - Enhanced error messaging for failed executions
  - Session limit handling with queue clearing

### 3. Refactored Main Page
- **Updated**: `src/app/tasker/page.tsx`
- **Removed** (moved to TaskRunnerHeader):
  - All execution logic functions
  - useRef for execution queue management
  - Auto-process useEffect
- **Simplified state management**:
  - Added error state
  - Created actions object for component communication
  - Cleaner component structure

### 4. Updated RequirementCard
- **Updated**: `src/app/features/TaskRunner/RequirementCard.tsx`
- Updated to use new type definitions from lib/types.ts

## New Features Added

### Auto-Delete on Success
- Requirements are automatically deleted from filesystem after successful execution
- Removes completed requirements from the UI
- Provides console logging for successful deletion

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Display error messages in the header UI
- Different error types handled:
  - Task execution failures
  - File deletion failures after success
  - Session limit reached
- Error messages can be dismissed by user
- Errors clear the execution queue appropriately

### Improved Architecture
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Centralized type definitions
- More maintainable component structure
- Better state management flow

## Key Benefits

1. **Lighter Main Page**: Reduced from ~200 lines to ~120 lines
2. **Better Organization**: Logic moved to appropriate components
3. **Type Safety**: Centralized interfaces prevent type mismatches
4. **Enhanced UX**: Better error feedback and auto-cleanup
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual features

## File Structure
```
src/app/features/TaskRunner/
├── lib/
│   └── types.ts              # Centralized interfaces
├── TaskRunnerHeader.tsx      # Header with execution logic
├── RequirementCard.tsx       # Individual requirement cards
└── ...
src/app/tasker/
└── page.tsx                  # Lighter main page component
```

All functionality remains the same for end users, but the codebase is now more organized and maintainable.
