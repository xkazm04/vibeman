## Evaluation Criteria

### Business Value (1-10)

Evaluate how much this idea contributes to product success, user satisfaction, and strategic goals.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Negligible impact. Nice-to-have with no measurable user or business outcome. No customer demand signal. |
| 3-4 | Minor improvement. Quality-of-life enhancement for a small subset of users. Weak alignment with strategy. |
| 5-6 | Moderate value. Clear benefit to a meaningful user segment OR solid alignment with one strategic priority. Some customer demand exists. |
| 7-8 | High value. Strong user impact across significant portion of user base. Directly supports current OKRs. Clear competitive or revenue implication. |
| 9-10 | Critical. Existential for product success, major revenue driver, or essential for competitive survival. Strong, repeated customer demand. Rare — reserve for transformational work. |

Consider: alignment with project goal, revenue potential, competitive necessity, customer demand signal strength, and strategic priority fit.

### Effort Estimate (1-10)

Evaluate the total cost to deliver: time, complexity, people, and coordination overhead.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Trivial. A few hours to a day. Single file or config change. No cross-team coordination. |
| 3-4 | Small. A few days of work. Localized to one module or service. Minimal testing surface. |
| 5-6 | Medium. One to two weeks. Multiple components affected. Requires thoughtful testing and possibly one other team's input. |
| 7-8 | Large. Several weeks to a month. Spans multiple services or systems. Requires coordination, new infrastructure, or significant refactoring. |
| 9-10 | Massive. Multi-month initiative. Requires dedicated team, new architecture, or foundational changes. High coordination overhead across org. |

Consider: scope of change, number of systems touched, need for new infrastructure, testing complexity, and existing code quality if modifying.

---

### Risk Level (1-10)

Evaluate the probability and severity of things going wrong during or after implementation.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Very safe. Well-understood change. Easily reversible. No security, data, or compliance surface. |
| 3-4 | Low risk. Minor uncertainty. Limited blast radius. Standard rollback possible. |
| 5-6 | Moderate risk. Some technical unknowns OR touches a sensitive area (payments, auth, PII). Requires careful testing. Rollback possible but not trivial. |
| 7-8 | High risk. Significant uncertainty. Depends on external systems or third parties. Potential for user-facing regression. Security or compliance review likely needed. |
| 9-10 | Critical risk. Novel technology or unproven approach. Hard to reverse. Major outage or data loss potential. Regulatory implications. Requires executive sign-off. |

Consider: technical uncertainty, dependency on external systems, potential for regression, security/compliance exposure, and reversibility.
